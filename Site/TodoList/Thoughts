Etkin Bir Chat Uygulaması
{
According to my thoughts here is how chat applications mostly work
Lets say we have a sender x and receiver y
When x sended a message the message goes to the database and also the message stored in the
senders computer,phone etc with a xml or json kind of file so with those tags they can identify who sended
the message and who received so it can be displayed correctly
When the receiver got online and clicked the senders link to see the messages that link works like this:
The message stored in json or xml type of file in the receiver after the file get done with it triggers an event
in the database and the message got deleted so they no longer need to worry about how much space it will take on the database
what if users want to delete and dont want to see messages between each other.
Because if they only use database if one of the user decided to delete the messages what would have happen you will be needing
two other fields with the type of one bit if its 1 user didnt delete the messages if its 0 user dont want to see messages between
each other anymore this is a quite more safe approach for users but not for database so the choose is depending on an developer
